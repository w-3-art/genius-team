# My Local Preferences (gitignored — private to you)
#
# This file is auto-added to .gitignore by Claude Code.
# Use it for personal project preferences that shouldn't be committed.
# Copy this template to your project root as CLAUDE.local.md and customize it.

## My Dev Environment
# - My dev server: http://localhost:3000
# - My API server: http://localhost:3001
# - My DB: postgres://localhost:5432/myproject_dev

## Personal Tooling
# - I use pnpm (not npm/yarn)
# - My IDE: Cursor (not VS Code)
# - Auto-lint on save is handled by my IDE — don't run it manually

## Personal Test Config
# - Integration tests need local Redis running on port 6379
# - Load test fixtures from: ./fixtures/local/

## Notes to myself
# Add any personal reminders, shortcuts, or context only relevant to you
