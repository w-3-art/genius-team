## [11.0.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- 🔀 **Multi-engine support** via `--engine` flag
  - `--engine=claude` — Claude Code only (default, existing behavior)
  - `--engine=codex` — Codex CLI only (creates `.agents/` folder, uses `AGENTS.md`)
  - `--engine=dual` — Both engines (shared skills, both instruction files)
- 📁 `.agents/` directory structure for Codex CLI
  - Symlinks to `.claude/skills/` in dual mode for shared skills
- 📄 `AGENTS.md` auto-generated for Codex compatibility
  - Adapted from `CLAUDE.md` with path/tool substitutions
- 🔄 Dual engine coordination
  - `.genius/dual-engine-state.json` for tracking engine usage
  - Shared artifacts between Claude and Codex sessions
- 📜 Updated `create.sh` one-liner to accept `--engine` flag:
  ```bash
  bash <(curl -fsSL .../create.sh) my-project --engine=dual
  ```

### Changed
- `setup.sh` now validates engine parameter (claude|codex|dual)
- Prerequisite checks are engine-aware (only checks relevant CLIs)
- JSON validation skips engine-specific files appropriately
- Summary and next-steps guidance customized per engine

### Note
- `--mode=dual` (Builder+Challenger workflow) and `--engine=dual` (Claude+Codex) are independent
- You can combine them: `--mode=dual --engine=dual` for maximum flexibility
