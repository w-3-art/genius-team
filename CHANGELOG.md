# Changelog

## [19.0.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added — Claude Code Channels & Mobile Vibe Coding
- 📱 **Claude Code Channels support** — Talk to your Genius Team session from Telegram or Discord. Vibe code from your phone, monitor builds from the train, brainstorm on the go. Full filesystem + MCP + git access through messaging apps.
- 🎙️ **Voice mode guide** — Use `/voice` for push-to-talk interactions with Genius Team. Perfect for brainstorming with genius-pm, quick design reviews, or hands-free coding sessions. 20 languages supported.

## [8.0.0] and earlier — Pre-open-source

Versions v1.0 through v8.x were internal/private iterations developed before the open-source release.

Key milestones:
- **v1.0–v4.x** — Initial concept: skill files + basic memory for personal use
- **v5.0–v6.x** — Multi-skill router, first QA loop, save-token mode
- **v7.0** — External MCP integrations (later removed in v9 for zero-dependency architecture)
- **v8.x** — Last private version before open-source rewrite

**v9.0.0 (2026-02-08)** was a clean-room rewrite for public release — no external MCPs, pure Claude Code + file system.
