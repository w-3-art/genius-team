# Genius Team v9.0 — Cursor Rules

## Project Context
Read `CLAUDE.md` at the project root for full instructions and conventions.

## Genius Team Conventions
- This project uses **Genius Team v9.0**, a structured AI product team framework
- 21+ specialized skills live in `.claude/skills/` — each has a `SKILL.md`
- Subagent definitions are in `.claude/agents/`
- Slash commands are in `.claude/commands/`

## Memory System
- Memory is file-based in `.genius/memory/`
- `BRIEFING.md` is auto-generated — don't edit manually
- `decisions.json` — key decisions with rationale
- `patterns.json` — code patterns and conventions
- `progress.json` — task progress tracking
- `errors.json` — resolved errors and solutions

## Workflow
1. **IDEATION phase**: Conversational — skills ask questions, user approves at checkpoints
2. **EXECUTION phase**: Autonomous — Agent Teams build in parallel with mandatory QA

## Task Tracking
- Tasks live in `.claude/plan.md` (checkbox format)
- State is tracked in `.genius/state.json`
- Progress summaries go in `PROGRESS.md`

## Key Rules
- Every code change must pass QA (Dev → QA-micro → Fix → Re-QA → ✅)
- Use `jq` for JSON manipulation
- Don't modify `.claude/settings.json` directly — use `configs/` and setup.sh
